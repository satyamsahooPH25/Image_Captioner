# Image_Captioner
## Here's what an image captioner typically does:
### Analyze the image: It uses computer vision to extract features from the image, and the context of the scene.
### Encode the features: These features are converted into a representation that the captioning model can understand.
### Generate captions: The model uses NLP to generate a sequence of words that describe the image content based on the encoded features.
