# Image_Captioner
Here's what an image captioner typically does:
Analyze the image: It uses computer vision to extract features from the image, such as shapes, colors, and objects.
Encode the features: These features are converted into a representation that the captioning model can understand.
Generate captions: The model uses NLP to generate a sequence of words that describe the image content based on the encoded features.
